## Submit a Pull Request
- Want to help update or add new scripts? Fork a copy of the Script Bank to your GitHub account, make appropriate changes, and then [submit a pull request](https://github.com/md35-gk/GMS-Script-Bank/compare).
- Your changes will be reviewed (but not tested, so make sure it actually works) and approved or rejected within 24 hours.
- Please keep in mind the following:

### When posting/updating scripts:
- Scripts must be placed in the correct version folder/sub-folder
- All script names must be the same as previously posted in past versions
- All changable value in scripts must be changed to "%arg" followed by a number, such as "%arg1"
- Tags must be added to the script if needed (**//not working** for not working scripts, **//auto bans** for autobannable scripts, and **//override** to load the script into the trainer regardless if it works or not)
